### Hola, I am Mayowa Adeoni👋
I am a Software Engineer (backend and frontend) committed to working according to specifications and requirements. My mantra in life is: 'if at first you don't succeed, call it version 1.0 and try again'. I am open to a Frontend role where I can further pursue my passion for technology. More importantly, I am always open to learning new things.
